# CS320
This is my submission for CS320 Module 8
This Java program helps you keep track of people's contact info like names, phone numbers, and addresses. I made sure the code works well by testing it a lot, checking that phone numbers must be exactly 10 digits, names can't be too long, and you can't add the same person twice. The tests showed that most of the code (over 87%) works as it should, which means it's pretty solid.
When I built this, I thought about what people would actually need. That's why the program checks that all info is correct before saving it and lets you easily add, change, or remove contacts. I kept the design simple by splitting things into clear parts, one part holds the contact info and another part handles adding and finding contacts. This makes the code easy to understand and fix if needed. I learned a lot about testing while making this program, which will help me write better code in the future.
